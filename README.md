### Rusty MUD
A small rust project where I explored the language and built a small tcp chat server!
Currently it sports just a command line interface, has only been tested on one machine, and clients can connect via netcat. Name inspiration is credited towards Prof. Adrian Sampson in his mention of MUDs - multi-user domain or dungeons, and functionality related to that may or may not be added soon.
